<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>
Weather Hunt uses data directly from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the most up to date and accurate forecasts. 
Every map view shows a forecast for over a hundred locations so you can quickly see how the weather is looking around you. 
In other weather apps you may need to save and swipe through countless locations to get an idea of the surrounding weather. 
Weather Hunt lets you simply swipe and pinch the map to the area you're interested in to see all the weather instantly.

Weather Hunt is available on the App Store now.
